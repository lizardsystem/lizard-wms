Changelog of lizard-wms
===================================================


1.15 (unreleased)
-----------------

- Set some link styling in popup.


1.14 (2012-12-13)
-----------------

- Refactored the popup table head. Deltaportaal needs a popup without a 
  table head.


1.13 (2012-12-12)
-----------------

- Fix a bug that resets options and categories from wms sources when reloading 
their wms connection from admin. 


1.12 (2012-12-10)
-----------------

- Rerelease due to missing migrations.

- Better mocking thanks to Remco.


1.11 (2012-12-10)
-----------------

- Added test for WMSSource creation from a WMSConnection.

- Added travis integration.

- WMSSource params combines _params and layer_name. This is to ease wms layer configuration.

1.10 (2012-11-27)
-----------------

- Properly set dependency versions.


1.9 (2012-11-29)
----------------

- Add sort for WMSSource by index and display name; in admin sort is on display
name.


1.8 (2012-11-27)
----------------

- Added a checkbox on wms sources to omit them when searching (="clicking on
  the map").

- Added jsonfield-based metadata field to wms sources. The old metadata text
  field has been removed. The metadata is shown in the description (which
  means a popup for workspace acceptables).

- Split WMSSource name into a display_name and a layer_name, so synchonization won't
  break the display name.


1.7 (2012-10-18)
----------------

- Added cql_filter options in the adapter_layer_json.

- Added a migration that removes the reproject option from all WMSSource and WMSConnection instances.

----------------

- Added error handling for GetCapabilities 1.1.1 calls.


1.3 (2012-07-10)
----------------

- Added checkbox for showing the legend of a WMS source (default: True). This
  way you can hide the legend if you know it to be bad or unclear.


1.2 (2012-06-20)
----------------

- Hardcoded WMS version to 1.1.1 because owslib doesn't support 1.3.0. See
  https://github.com/lizardsystem/lizard-wms/issues/5

- Added admin site action for reloading WMS connections. This replaces the
  ``fetch_wms_layers`` management command. There is reasonable error reporting
  to help debug what's wrong with a WMS connection.

- Add a custom label for the category selection field.

- Support custom legend url for map layers and show them in the sidebar. Do
  not show legends in the hover popup.

- Update WMS source features upon 'save'. Also added action to update the
  bounding boxes for all sources.

- Deal with zoom ratio (radius) on mouseover and popup (click) searches.
